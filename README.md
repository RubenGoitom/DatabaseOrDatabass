CustomerController
This is a REST controller class in a Spring Boot application that handles CRUD operations for customers. It uses the CustomerService class to interact with the data store and handle the business logic.

Endpoints
The controller exposes the following endpoints:

GET /customers - Retrieves a list of all customers
GET /customers/{id} - Retrieves a customer by their ID
GET /customers/name/{name} - Retrieves a list of customers by their name
POST /customers - Saves a new customer to the data store
PUT /customers - Updates an existing customer in the data store
GET /customers/max/country - Retrieves the country with the most customers
GET /customers/highest/spender - Retrieves the customer who has spent the most
GET /customers/popular/genre/{id} - Retrieves the most popular genre of a customer by ID
GET /customers/limit - Retrieves a list of customers with a limit and offset.
Dependencies
This controller class is dependent on the CustomerService class, which is responsible for interacting with the data store and handling the business logic. The controller uses the Autowired annotation to inject an instance of the service class into the controller.

Usage
To use this controller class, you will need to have a Spring Boot application set up and configure the necessary dependencies for handling web requests and data storage. Additionally, you will need to provide an implementation of the CustomerService class that the controller can use to interact with the data store.

Once the dependencies are set up and the controller is wired into the application, you can start the application and send HTTP requests to the exposed endpoints to interact with the customers data.
